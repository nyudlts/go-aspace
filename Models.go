Clare immigrants, in 1947 and they had one son, Sean (1950 – 1997).  In 1960, Dorothy Hayden became one of the first meter maids for the New York City Department of Traffic and by 1982 retired as the Chief of Administration of the Bureau of Enforcement of the NYC Transportation Department. In 1984 she became the first woman, as well as the first American-born person, to be elected president of the Kilkenny Association.  In 1989 she was again honored as the first woman Grand Marshall of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade.  She and John Cudahy were active all their lives in numerous Irish organizations, both as members and officers.\n\nJames Hayden, a well known emcee and columnist for the <emph render=\"italic\">Irish Echo</emph>, began broadcasting the <emph render=\"italic\">Irish Memories</emph> radio program in 1930 over local station WEVD.
